\section{Evaluation of Viva Performance}\label{sec:viva.tex}
    \subsection{Presentation}\label{subsec:viva-presentation}
        First run through on morning of

        Did not take offer of practice ahead of time - limited usefulness of comments

        Performance of different team members
        Pav nervous, answered questions worst.
        Paul competent, mostly seemed to contribute to the admin-y stuff
        Oscar appeared to have done the most work and had the best overall understanding of the system - in line with observations during project

        Overall a comprehensive and professional presentation.
        Simple project, gave sense of their process.
        Answered questions quite well - highlighted areas for future improvement.

    \subsection{Demonstration}\label{subsec:viva-demonstration}
        Had some issues on the morning before the run-through

        Worked during run-through on the maze they built for themselves
        Appeared to be the maze they used for testing throughout.
        In run-through had some issues with the test maze provided by the examiners.
        Had uploaded wrong code?

        In actual vive, had issues with both their own maze and the test maze.
        Did work sometimes, issues not consistent - noise
        Ultimately did navigate the maze, but required manual selection of the most appropriate algorithm for the maze.

    \subsection{Olympiad}\label{subsec:viva-olympiad}
