    \subsection{Contribution to Part Bs}\label{subsec:reflection-partBs}
        Lack of systems knowledge
        Provided resources
        The use of these tools was clear by the end of the project
        Useful going forwards.
        Did not teach all they might need - beyond scope of my role.

        Advice on technical writing
        Useful for datasheet

        Did not need a lot of advice on teamwork - pretty self-sufficient.
        Did not need a lot of technical advice - thank god.

        Could have provided better advice on working to objectives/project management.
        Might have helped some/made work more focused.
