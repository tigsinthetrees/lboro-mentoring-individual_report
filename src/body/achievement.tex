\section{Analysis of Achievement}\label{sec:achievement}
    Belbin identified that they did not have strong people skills.
    This cost them in the performance in the presentation.
    However, presentation skills had definitely improved over the in-company meetings - should have been one of their objectives.
    They made mistakes in the viva that they did not make in the company meetings - usually in company meetings they had no PowerPoint, and thus did not read from it, or pack it with text.
    If they needed to have a powerpoint in the final presentation, they should have practiced with it throughout.

    Also lacked in management as a result of lack of clear people person.
    Reflected in their (lack of) use of formal management tools.
    Additionally, while they had an operational and functional requirements, they did not create non-functional requirements for their system.
    This meant that they had nothing to test it against, and verification was therefore lacking/informal.
    Possibly as a result of this, their fault-finding was also fairly informal.
    Inefficient - picked up in viva questions, and affected robot performance.

    However, informal team structure was quite resilient to risk.
    They had contingencies to allow subbing in new team members if someone was sick.
    Resulted in a high level of achievement - they could get a lot done, had plenty of time for testing (though they did not use this time especially well).
