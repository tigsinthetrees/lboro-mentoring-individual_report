\section*{Abstract}
    This report explores the performance of a group of Part B students attempting the maze-solver challenge.
    The team resisted the use of formal management techniques, or a requirements' specification, but performed well regardless.
    It is suggested that this was possible because the students unknowingly adopted the assessment brief as their requirements.
    The Belbin test was found to be an accurate predictor of the performance of each team member, and identified risks, which could then be mitigated.
    Overall, is shown that interventions from the mentors assisted the group with presenting the project, but ultimately demonstrated the benefits of systems engineering better to the Part D mentors than to the Part Bs.
